<p className="font3 FinalSectionPara">Nikhil Bhardwaj is a struggling businessman who loves Karishma Solanki, an actress. Nikhil believes that once committed to a girl, there should be no straying, so he asks Karishma's father, Devesh, to help him with ₹50 million before marriage to earn a contract. However, Devesh sidesteps his request, thus forcing him to prove his worth on his own.

Sometime later, Nikhil meets Meeta, Karishma's younger sister, whom he had a brief encounter with seven years ago. Meeta, an IITian in Chemical Engineering and PhD, is a super-intelligent geek with unusual habits and tics.</p>
